# Boosting-Retention-with-Google-Cloud-Analytics
# üîç Executive Summary 
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving using Google Cloud. By leveraging BigQuery for data storage, Python and PyCaret for model building, and Looker Studio for visualization, the project aims to provide actionable insights into employee churn. The predictive dashboard will enable stakeholders to identify at-risk employees, understand the factors driving churn, and implement targeted retention strategies.

# üíº Business Problem
The primary goal is to address employee turnover, a critical business challenge impacting productivity, morale, and financial performance. By identifying employees likely to leave, the organization can implement proactive retention strategies, reducing costs associated with recruitment and training, and improving overall employee satisfaction.

# ü§ñ Methodology
1.Data Ingestion and Preparation: Employee data is extracted from CSV files and loaded into BigQuery for efficient storage and querying.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct in-depth analysis to understand data characteristics, identify patterns, and generate insights. 
3.Model Building: Utilize PyCaret for automated machine learning to build and evaluate various models, selecting the best-performing one. 
4.Model Deployment: Integrate the trained model into a Looker Studio dashboard for real-time predictions and visualization.
5.Dashboard Development: Create a user-friendly dashboard showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs), churn predictions, and actionable insights.

# üíª Skills Utilized
1.	Data Engineering: BigQuery, SQL
2.	Data Analysis: Python, Pandas, NumPy
3.	Machine Learning: PyCaret
4.	Data Visualization: Looker Studio
5.	Cloud Computing: Google Cloud Platform

# üß© Results
The project successfully developed a predictive model capable of identifying employees at risk of leaving. The model's accuracy and performance were evaluated using relevant metrics. Key findings include:
1. Predictive Accuracy: 85% accuracy rate was attained in anticipating possible employee attrition, allowing 
for focused retention initiatives.
2. These are the features affecting the employee churn rate:
   Satisfaction Level, Last Evaluation, Number of Projects, Average Monthly Hours, Time Spent at the Company, Work 
   Accident, Promotion in the Last 5 Years
3. Identification of At-Risk employees: Successfully identified key factors contributing to employee turnover, including job satisfaction, tenure, and engagement levels. This insight allowed for the development of customized retention plans

# üí° Business Recommendations
1.	Improve employee satisfaction: Implement initiatives to enhance employee engagement, recognition, and work-life balance.
2.	Address salary concerns: Conduct salary benchmarking and adjust compensation accordingly to retain top talent.
3.	Strengthen onboarding and training: Provide comprehensive onboarding programs to improve new employee retention.
4.	Monitor departmental churn: Identify departments with high turnover rates and implement targeted retention strategies.
5.	Continuous monitoring: Regularly evaluate model performance and update as needed to ensure accuracy.
